On this page, you will find my **professional web page**. Please, keep in mind that it is ==under construction==. I apology for any inconveniences it may cause you.

Also, I included the *Contact form* on this page just to add more elements to it (and to practice with an element I had never worked before), but I did not include the PHP script. Thus, the form does not work. 

Let's work together to improve this page! :smile: Does it sound good to you? If so, feel free to contact me at [e-mail address](sonia.lopez@etu.unige.ch) if:
- You spot a typo or a grammar mistake.
- You have comments or suggestions to improve this page.
- You have a service suggestion.
- You would like to collaborate with me professionally.[^1]

**Thank you in advance for considering collaborating with me!**
